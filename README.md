# OpenLearning
OpenLearning is a project that aims to create predefined AI models for games, functions, and more.

# It's open source?
Yes, all the models and code created by the OpenLearning founders themselves are open source, and anyone can alter and modify them as they wish.

## Where can I get the codes and templates?
Well... you can't do it yet, we're still working on the project, but we'll add it as soon as possible for testing, meaning that there will probably be some bugs and glitches at launch.
